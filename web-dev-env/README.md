web develop environment


this can compile es6 to es5 with polyfill,


also can compile scss file to css,


handler jpg and png files' url is also ok,


I also make window.$ connect to jQuery(version 1.11.3),and can be used in all js files


also have ugilfy and source map file,remember to set false before release


watch is set true,this means I don't need to run shell every time I changes the js files


async is also being change to generator


now, I can use es6 in ie8(fuck ie7,ie6,ie5),awesome right?


above is awesome? no!!! no!!! no!!!

I use webstorm to compile scss file, use cdn to import jq,


watch is to expensive,so I close it.


Now! I! can! run! async! in! ie5!


I felt that Virgin Mary's breast is in my hands!


usage:

```shell
    npm install
    npm run build
```
